index.html contains the code for [my personal website](https://dzhano.github.io/)
It contains html code that displays different elements on my webpage. For five days I have uploaded different kind of context to fill the requirements for my [assignment](https://intro-to-git.github.io/homeworks/homework1/)

Day 1: Simple greeting message: "Hello Professor! Welcome to my website!". I used simple \<h1> and \<p> elements.<br />
Day 2: Adding a screenshot of Windows Powershell of my work yesterday through <img> element.<br />
Day 3: Adding my CV to the GitHub repository and giving a link to it in index.html. I decided to add a photo for fun and to make the download button standout, rather than just being a simple plain text.<br />
Day 4: Adding a couple of playlists from Spotify its their in-build HTML integration function for websites.<br />
Day 5: Adding a video from YouTube through its in-build HTML integration function for websites.
